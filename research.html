            <h3>Current Work</h3>
                In the fall of 2024, I joined Prof.Wang Zhanfeng's research group. Wang recommended me to try to study the problem of sequential interval estimation under distributed conditions. I have some ideas about it now.<br>
                In addition, the group is holding a seminar about a book this semester, the slides is <a href="slides/2025_spring/Approximation Theorems of Mathematical Statistics/index.html">here</a>.

            <h3>Undergraduate Work</h3>
                Under the guidance of Prof.Wen Canhong, I read some statistics books to strengthen my knowledge base, such as "High-Dimensional Statistics A Non-Asymptotic Viewpoint" written by Martin J. Wainwright and "Optimization" written by Wen Zaiwen. Wen recommended me some articles on subgroup analysis and variable selection in high dimensions. Wen hoped that I would conduct research on the sliced inverse regression as my graduation thesis, but for various reasons, I failed to produce outstanding innovative results. My undergraduate thesis was a review article on SIR.
